***functions
one can create functions and pass values/objects/or even another function;

example of a function being fed another function;

//function declaration;
function onDead(func){
	func()
}


//in another file the function gets called;

lets pretend that we coded that is a player dies; 
onDead() gets called automatically;

what is really powerful is we know onDead() gets called;
so we can take advantage of that and feed onDead a function of our own;

for example:
onDead(handleDie)


function handleDie(){    <---- handleDie is a function that performs whatever we want it to perform!
	givePlayerMoney();
	unlockSecretDoor();
	etc,etc,etc()
}
